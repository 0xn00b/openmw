\section{OpenCS starting dialog}
\subsection{Introduction}
The great day has come. Today, you shall open \OCS{} application. And when you do this, you shall see our starting dialog window that holds three buttons
that can bring both pain and happiness. So just do this, please.

\subsection{Basics}
Back to the manual? Great! As you can see, the starting window holds just three buttons. Since you are already familiar with our files system, they come
to you with no surprise.\\

First, there is a \textbf{Create A New Game} button. Clearly, you should press it when you want to create a game file. Than, what \textbf{Create A New Addon} button do?
Yes! You are right! This button will create any addon content file (and new project file associated with it)! Wonderful! And what the last remaining button do? \textbf{Edit A Content File}? Well, it comes with no surprise that this should be used when you need to alter existing content file, either a game or addon.\\

\paragraph{Selecting Files}
As We wrote earlier,

\subsection{Advanced}
If you are paying attention, you noticed any extra icon with wrench. This one will open small settings window. Options here are few, and easy to list.
\begin{description}
 \item {Window Size} is needed to configure initial window size of the starting window.
 \item {Display format} can be used to configure behavior of the \OCS{} itself, however only in the limited degree. You can decide if you want \OCS{} to display icon, text or both in some columns of tables.
\end{description}

%TODO configuration

And that would be it. There is no point spending more time here. We should go forward now.
