\section{Files and Directories}
\subsection{Introduction}
As you imagine, there is no other way to store and distribute computer data without files. You surely know that each file in your file system is identified by the unique path. This is basic knowledge, and applies to both Open{MW} and Open{CS} alike.\\

Needless to say, this chapter describes paths and files that are used/created/edited with OpenCS editor.\\

\subsection{Basics}

\paragraph{Directories}
Open{CS} user should consider two directory paths in his system. So called ``User Configuration Path'' and ``Data Path''. ``User Configuration Path'' stores basically all Open{MW} specific files that are supposed to be touched by the user, while ``Data Path''%This is wrong, pay no mind to it.

\paragraph{Files}
Bethesda Morrowind engine is using two types of files: esm (master) and esp (plugin). The distinction between those is not clear, and often confusing, mostly because large esp files could hurt stability. Open{MW} supports both esm and esp files, but in order to make use of new features of OpenMW one should consider using new file types designed with our engine in mind: game files and addon files.\\

Game and Addon files are concept descended from old esm/esp system, but much more flexible and cleaner. Finally, We can describe the difference between those two file types use case with pure statements. If you want to make new game using Open{MW} as engine (so called ``total conversion'') you should create a game file. If you want to create a addon for existing game file -- simply create addon file. The addon size is not a factor here. The only distinction you should consider is if your project is about changing other game, or creating a new one. Simple as that.

%TODO describe some characteristics, like file extensions. What about project files?

The actual creating of new files is described in the next chapter. Here We are gonna focus only on details that you need to know in order to create your first Open{CS} file while full understanding your needs.

\paragraph{Dependencies}
Since addon is supposed to change the game it is logical that it also depends on the said game. It simply can't work otherwise. Just think about it: your modification is changing prize of the iron sword. But what if there is no iron sword in game? That's right: we get nonsense. What you want to do is to tie your addon to the files you are changing. Those can be either game files (expansion island for a game) or other addon files (house on the said island). It is a a good idea to be dependent only on files that are really changed in your addon obviously, but sadly there is no other way to achieve this than knowing what you want to do.
