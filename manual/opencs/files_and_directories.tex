\section{Files and Directories}
\subsection{Introduction}
As you imagine, there is no other way to store and distribute computer data without files. You surely know that each file in your file system is identified by the unique path. This is basic knowledge, and applies to both Open{MW} and Open{CS} alike.\\

Needless to say, this chapter describes paths and files that are used/created/edited with OpenCS editor.\\

\subsection{Basics}

\paragraph{Directories}
Open{MW} and Open{CS} uses multiple directories on file systems, however from end user perspective only two matters. That's it: user path and game path.\\

User path is the per user path that holds both configuration files and the content/project files (described later). Game path on the other hand, is the location of your game (most likely Morrowind\texttrademark).

%TODO give correct path

\paragraph{Content files}
Bethesda Morrowind engine is using two types of files: esm (master) and esp (plugin). The distinction between those is not clear, and often confusing, mostly because large esp files could hurt stability. Open{MW} supports both esm and esp files, but in order to make use of new features of OpenMW one should consider using new file types designed with our engine in mind: game files and addon files together called ``content files``.\\

Game and Addon files are concept descended from old esm/esp system, but much more flexible and cleaner. We can describe the difference between those two file types use case with clean statements. If you want to make new game using Open{MW} as engine (so called ``total conversion'') you should create a game file. If you want to create a addon for existing game file -- simply create addon file. The addon size is not a factor here. The only distinction you should consider is if your project is about changing other game, or creating a new one. Simple as that.\\

%TODO describe some characteristics, like file extensions. What about project files?

The actual creating of new files is described in the next chapter. Here We are gonna focus only on details that you need to know in order to create your first Open{CS} file while full understanding your needs. For now let's jut remember that content files are created inside the user directory, in the the \textbf{data} subfolder. Open{CS} scans for content files not only data subfolder but also the game path, most likely directory where you installed or unpacked Morrowind\texttrademark. However it is probably better to not pollute game path, and use only data path for Open{MW} content files, both when creating and only playing with others content files.\\

\paragraph{Project files}
Project files act as containers for data not used by the Openm{MW} game engine itself, but still useful for OpenCS. The shining example of this data category are without doubt record filters (described in the later section of the manual you are reading currently). As a mod author you probably don't need or want to distribute project files among players, but for sure you will want to aid all your colleagues working together with you on, well project. As you would imagine, project file makes sense only in combination with actual content files. In fact, each time you start to work on new content file and project file was not found it will be created.\\ 
Project files extension is, to not surprise ``.project''. The whole name of the project file is the whole name of the content file with appended extensions. For instance awesomeswords.omwaddon file is associated with awesomeswords.omwaddon.project file.\\

%TODO where are they stored.
Project files are stored inside the user directory, in the \textbf{projects} subfolder. This is the path location for both freshly created project files, and the place where Open{CS} look for already existing files.

\paragraph{Dependencies}
Since addon is supposed to change the game it is logical that it also depends on the said game. It simply can't work otherwise. Just think about it: your modification is changing prize of the iron sword. But what if there is no iron sword in game? That's right: we get nonsense. What you want to do is to tie your addon to the files you are changing. Those can be either game files (expansion island for a game) or other addon files (house on the said island). It is a a good idea to be dependent only on files that are really changed in your addon obviously, but sadly there is no other way to achieve this than knowing what you want to do.\\

Game files are not intend to have any dependencies for a very simple reasons: player is using only one game file at the time and therefore no game file can depend on other game file, and since game file makes the base for addon files -- it can't depend on addon files.
