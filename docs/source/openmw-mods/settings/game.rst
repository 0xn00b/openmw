show owned
----------

:Type:		integer
:Range:		0, 1, 2, 3
:Default:	0

Enable visual clues for items owned by NPCs when the crosshair is on the object. If the setting is 0, no clues are provided which is the default Morrowind behavior. If the setting is 1, the background of the tool tip for the object is highlight in the color specified by the color background owned setting in the GUI Settings Section. If the setting is 2, the crosshair is the color of the color crosshair owned setting in the GUI Settings section. If the setting is 3, both the tool tip background and the crosshair are colored. The crosshair is not visible if crosshair is false.

The default value is 0 (no clues). This setting can only be configured by editing the settings configuration file.

best attack
-----------

:Type:		boolean
:Range:		True/False
:Default:	False

If this boolean setting is true, the player character will always use the most powerful attack when striking with a weapon (chop, slash or thrust). If this setting is false, the type of attack is determined by the direction that the character is moving at the time the attack begins.

The default value is false. This setting can be toggled with the Always Use Best Attack button in the Prefs panel of the Options menu.
