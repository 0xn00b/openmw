physics framerate
---------------

:Type:		floating point
:Range:		10.0 to 60.0
:Default:	60.0

Allows to set how frequently an engine will do physics calculations. A default value is 60 times per second.
This setting allows developers with low-clocked CPUs to test an engine.
Changing from default value can lead to physics bugs. Change this setting on your own risk, and reset a value to default before filling a physics-related bugreport!
