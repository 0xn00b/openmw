OpenMW - the completely unofficial reimplementation of Morrowind
================================================================

OpenMW is an open source reimplementation of the Morrowind game
engine. For more information, see README.txt or

Building from source
====================

Supported Windows platforms:
----------------------------

Only tested on Windows XP. If you manage to compile or run OpenMW on
another Windows platform (9x/Me/NT/Vista), please let me know!


Dependencies:
-------------

Dependencies needed to build OpenMW:

OGRE 1.4.9         (3d engine)
Audiere 1.9.4      (sound engine)
Mingw              (C++ compiler)
gdc 4.1.3 (mingw)  (D compiler)

The above versions are the ones I have tested recently, but other
versions might work. OGRE, Audiere and OIS are complex libraries with
their own set of dependencies. I recomend downloading prebuild SDKs
instead of building them from source. You can find these here:

OGRE:     http://ogre3d.org (See "Getting Ogre" above)
Audiere:  http://audiere.sourceforge.net/
OIS:      Comes with Ogre
Mingw     http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/
gdc       http://sourceforge.net/projects/gdcwin/

(Note that the "official" D compiler, DMD, will not work, because it
is incompatible with most C++ compilers in Windows.)


Setting everything up:
----------------------

First, install Mingw (get the automatic installer.) Make sure gcc and
g++ packages are selected.

Next install the gdcwin installer (the package named 'gdc') and
install it (the default is to install it in the same dir as mingw,
this is ok.)

Open a command line. Set up your PATH to include Mingw and gdc
(eg. "set PATH=%PATH%;c:\mingw\bin"). Make sure the commands g++ and
gdc work (should output "no input files".)

The build script expects to find the Ogre and Audiere SDKs in the
parent directory. An example directory structure is:

c:\openmw\Ogre       - Ogre SDK
c:\openmw\Audiere    - Audiere SDK
c:\openmw\openmw     - OpenMW source


Building
--------

To build, simply run build_openmw.bat


Running

Good luck!
