OpenMW - the completely unofficial reimplementation of Morrowind
================================================================

OpenMW is an open source reimplementation of the Morrowind game
engine. For more information, see README.txt or

    http://openmw.snaptoad.com/




Installation from source
========================

(this file is NOT complete!)


Supported Windows platforms:
----------------------------

Only tested on Windows XP. If you manage to compile or run OpenMW on
another Windows platform (9x/Me/NT/Vista), please let me know!


Dependencies:
-------------

Dependencies needed to build OpenMW:

OGRE 1.4.5         (3d engine)
Audiere 1.9.4      (sound engine)
OIS-1.0.0          (input system)
Mingw              (C++ compiler)
gdc 4.1.3 (mingw)  (D compiler)
Monster 0.8        (scripting language and tools)
DSSS 0.75          (D build tool)

The above versions are the ones I have tested recently, but other
versions might work. OGRE, Audiere and OIS are comples libraries with
their own set of dependencies. I recomend downloading prebuild SDKs
instead of building them from source. You can find these here:

OGRE:     http://ogre3d.org
Audiere:  http://audiere.sourceforge.net/
OIS:      http://sourceforge.net/projects/wgois/
DSSS:     http://svn.dsource.org/projects/dsss/downloads/
Monster:  http://monster.snaptoad.com/download.html

(Note that the "official" compiler, DMD, will not work, because it is
incompatible with most modern C++ compilers in Windows.)

(notes to write: you must use the command line, and mingw - cygwin
does not work.)


Building:
---------

(to be written)

If something goes terribly wrong during the build (which isn't
unlikely), and you figure out how to solve it, I would appreciate if
you told me about it so I could update these instructions.




Installation from binary
========================

(not written yet)




Configuration
=============

Before you can run OpenMW, you have to help it find the Morrowind data
files. The 'openmw' program needs the files Morrowind.esm and
Morrowind.bsa, and the directories Sound\ and Music\ from your
"Morrowind\Data Files\" directory. By default it expects to find these
in the data\ directory. You can change this in the openmw.ini file.

(todo: write about directory structure, dlls and ogre plugins here)

The first time you run openmw you will be asked to set screen
resolution and other graphics settings. You can bring this dialogue up
at any time with the -oc command line switch. I don't recommend using
fullscreen mode yet, since it might mess up your screen and input
settings if the program crashes.




Running OpenMW
==============

If Azura is with you and all the stars and planets are aligned in your
favor, you should now be able to run OpenMW using the program called
'openmw'.

Write openmw -h to see a list of options.

Running without parameters should bring you into the cave called Sud,
or the last cell loaded. You are in free float mode. Move around with
WASD (or arrow keys), move up and down with left shift and ctrl, exit
with 'q' or escape. Note that if you have a localized (non-English)
version, the cell "Sud" might not exist. I will solve this issue in a
later version.

To load another cell, specify the cell name on the command line. Use
the 'esmtool' program to get a list of cells. Note that you must use
quotation marks "" if the cell name contains spaces or other weird
characters. Exterior cells are disabled at the moment.

Enjoy! ;-)
