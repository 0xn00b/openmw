OpenMW - the completely unofficial reimplementation of Morrowind
================================================================

OpenMW is an open source reimplementation of the Morrowind game
engine. For more information, see README.txt or

    http://openmw.snaptoad.com/




Building from source
====================


Supported Windows platforms:
----------------------------

Only tested on Windows XP. If you manage to compile or run OpenMW on
another Windows platform (9x/Me/NT/2000/Vista), please let me know!



Dependencies:
-------------

To compile OpenMW you need Mingw with g++ (a C++ compiler) and gdc
(the D compiler.) You can find them here:

Mingw     http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/
gdc       http://sourceforge.net/projects/gdcwin/

Note that the "official" D compiler, DMD, will not currently work on
Windows, because it is uses an object format incompatible with most
C++ compilers.

As of verion 0.4, all library dependencies have been included in the
single file openmw-dll-pack.zip for convenience. Simply download the
file and unpack it in the same directory as the OpenMW source
code. You should not need to download any other files.



Setting everything up
---------------------

First, install Mingw (get the automatic installer.) Make sure gcc and
g++ packages are selected.

Next install the gdcwin installer (the package named 'gdc') and
install it in the same directory as Mingw.

Open a command line. Set up your PATH to include Mingw and gdc
(eg. "set PATH=%PATH%;c:\mingw\bin").

Next you must make sure the D include files are found by the
compiler. Run the following command:
set DFLAGS=-Ic:\mingw\include\d\3.4.5\
where the path following -I is the path of your Mingw GDC include
directory.

Make sure the commands g++ and gdc work (should output "no input
files".)



Manually installing dependencies:
---------------------------------

If you download the DLL pack mentioned above, you can skip this
section. If you wish to install dependencies manually though, here is
a list of dependencies and where you can find them:

OGRE:     http://ogre3d.org
OIS:      Comes with the Ogre SDK
OpenAL:   http://openal.org/
FFmpeg:   http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/

The biggest problem is the lack of a prebuilt SDK for FFmpeg. You must
build it under Mingw as well (not Cygwin!). I found the following link
helpful (read the comments as well, not just the post itself):

Building
--------

To build, simply run build_openmw.bat



Running
-------

For instructions on how to set everything up after compilation, see
README-win32.txt.

Good luck!
