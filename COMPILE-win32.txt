OpenMW - the completely unofficial reimplementation of Morrowind
================================================================

OpenMW is an open source reimplementation of the Morrowind game
engine. For more information, see README.txt or

    http://openmw.snaptoad.com/




Building from source
====================


Supported Windows platforms:
----------------------------

Mostly tested on Windows XP, but Vista is also rumored to work. If you
manage to compile or run OpenMW on another Windows platform
(9x/Me/NT/2000), please let me know.

At the moment, only command line building is supported.



Dependencies:
-------------

To compile OpenMW you need Mingw with g++ (a C++ compiler) and gdc
(the D compiler.) You can find them here:

Mingw:    http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/
gdc:      http://sourceforge.net/projects/gdcwin/

Note that the "official" D compiler, DMD, will not currently work on
Windows, because it is uses an object format incompatible with most
C++ compilers.

All library dependencies are included in the file
openmw-dll-pack.zip. Simply download this file and unpack it in the
same directory as the OpenMW source code. You should not need to
download any other dependencies.



Setting everything up
---------------------

First, install Mingw (get the automatic installer.) Make sure gcc and
g++ packages are selected.

Next install the gdcwin installer (the package named 'gdc') and
install it in the same directory as Mingw.

Open a command line. Set up your PATH to include Mingw and gdc
(eg. "set PATH=%PATH%;c:\mingw\bin").

Next you must make sure the D include files are found by the
compiler. Run the following command:
set DFLAGS=-Ic:\mingw\include\d\3.4.5\
where the path following -I is the path of your Mingw GDC include
directory.

Make sure the commands g++ and gdc work (should output "no input
files".)



Building
--------

To build, simply run build_openmw.bat



Running
-------

For instructions on how to set everything up after compilation, see
README-win32.txt.

Good luck!
