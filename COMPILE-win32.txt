OpenMW - the completely unofficial reimplementation of Morrowind
================================================================

OpenMW is an open source reimplementation of the Morrowind game
engine. For more information, see README.txt or

    http://openmw.snaptoad.com/




Building from source
====================

Supported Windows platforms:
----------------------------

Only tested on Windows XP. If you manage to compile or run OpenMW on
another Windows platform (9x/Me/NT/Vista), please let me know!


Dependencies:
-------------

Dependencies needed to build OpenMW:

OGRE 1.4.9         (3d engine)
OpenAL             (3d sound system)
libavcodec,
  libavformat      (For MP3 playback)
Mingw              (C++ compiler)
gdc 4.1.3 (mingw)  (D compiler)

The above versions are the ones I have tested recently, but other
versions might work. OGRE, OpenAL and OIS are complex libraries with
their own set of dependencies. I recommend downloading prebuild SDKs
instead of building them from source.

libavcodec and libavformat are part of the FFmpeg package, which is
part of the 'mplayer' project. Note that some of the codecs might be
patented in your country.

You can find the libraries here:

OGRE:     http://ogre3d.org (See "Getting Ogre" in README-win32.txt for details)
OIS:      Comes with the Ogre SDK
OpenAL:   http://openal.org/
Mingw     http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/
gdc       http://sourceforge.net/projects/gdcwin/

(Note that the "official" D compiler, DMD, will not currently work on
Windows, because it is incompatible with most C++ compilers.)


Setting everything up
---------------------

First, install Mingw (get the automatic installer.) Make sure gcc and
g++ packages are selected.

Next install the gdcwin installer (the package named 'gdc') and
install it in the same directory as Mingw.

Open a command line. Set up your PATH to include Mingw and gdc
(eg. "set PATH=%PATH%;c:\mingw\bin"). Make sure the commands g++ and
gdc work (should output "no input files".)

The build script expects to find the Ogre and Audiere SDKs in the
parent directory. An example directory structure is:

c:\openmw\Ogre       - Ogre SDK
c:\openmw\openmw     - OpenMW source


Building
--------

To build, simply run build_openmw.bat


Running
-------

For instructions on how to set everything up after compilation, see
README-win32.txt.

Good luck!
