[Camera]

# This floating point setting controls the distance to the near
# clipping plane.  The value must be greater than zero.  Values
# greater than approximately 18.0 will occasionally clip objects in
# the world in front of the character.  Values greater than
# approximately 8.0 will clip the character's hands in first person
# view and/or the back of their head in third person view.
near clip = 5.0

# This boolean setting determines whether objects that render to one
# pixel or smaller will be culled.  It generally improves performance
# to enable this feature.
small feature culling = true

# Set the maximum visible distance.  Larger values significantly
# improve rendering in exterior spaces, but also increase the amount
# rendered geometry and significantly reduce the frame rate.  This
# value is a floating point value that defaults to 6666.0.  This value
# interacts with the "exterior cell load distance" setting in that
# it's probably undesired for this value to provide visibility into
# cells that have not yet been loaded.  When cells are visible before
# loading, the geometry will "pop-in" suddenly, creating a jarring
# visual effect.  To prevent this effect, this value must be less
# than:
#
#   8192 * exterior cell load distance - 1024
#
# The constant 8192 is the size of a cell, and 1024 is the threshold
# distance for loading a new cell.  Additionally, the "field of view"
# setting also interacts with this setting because the view frustrum
# end is a plane, so you can see further at the edges of the screen
# than you should be able to.  This can be observed in game by looking
# at distant objects and rotating the camera so the object are near
# the edge of the screen.  As a result, the "viewing distance" setting
# should further be reduced by a factor that depends on the "field of
# view" setting.  In the default configuration this reduction is 7%.
# Using this factor, approximate values recommended for other
# "exterior cell load distance" settings are: 14285 for 2 cells, 21903
# for 3 cells, 29522 for 4 cells, and 35924 for 5 cells.
# 
# Reductions of up 25% or more can be required to completely eliminate
# pop-in for wide fields of view and long viewing distances near the
# edges of the screen, but such situations are unusual and probably
# not worth the performance penalty introduced by loading geometry
# obscured by fog in the center of the screen.
#
# This setting can be adjusted in game from the ridiculously low value
# of 2000 to a maximum of 6666, using the "View Distance" slider in
# the Detail tab of the Video panel of the Options menu.  See
# RenderingManager::configureFog for the relevant source code.

[Cells]

# This integer setting determines the number of exterior cells
# adjacent to the character that will be loaded for rendering.  It
# interacts with "viewing distance" and "field of view" as described
# previously, and it is generally very wasteful for this value to load
# geometry than will almost never be visible due to viewing distance
# and fog.  For low frame rate screenshots of scenic vistas, this
# setting should be set high, and viewing distances adjusted
# accordingly.  This value must be greater than or equal to 1.

# the normal damage.  A value of 100 results in the player taking 6
# times as much damage, but inflicting only 80% of the usual damage.
# Values less than -500 will result in the player receiving no damage,

[General]

# Set the maximum anisotropic filtering on textures.  Anisotropic
# filtering is a method of enhancing the image quality of textures on
# surfaces that are at oblique viewing angles with respect to the
# camera.  Valid values range from 0 to 16.  Modern video cards can
# often perform 8 or 16 anisotropic filtering with a minimal
# performance impact.  This effect of this setting can be seen in the
# Video panel of the Options menu by finding a location with straight
# lines (striped rugs and Balmora cobblestones work well) radiating
# into the distance, and adjusting the anisotropy slider.  This
# setting can be changed in game using the "Anisotropy" slider in the
# Detail tab of the Video panel of the Options menu.
anisotropy = 4

# Sets the camera field of view in degrees.  Recommended values range
# from 30 degrees to 110 degrees.  Small values provide a very narrow
# field of view that creates a "zoomed in" effect, while large values
# cause distortion at the edges of the screen.  The "field of view"
# setting interacts with aspect ratio of your video resolution in that
# more square aspect ratios (e.g. 4:3) need a wider field of view to
# more resemble the same field of view on a widescreen (e.g. 16:9)
# monitor.  This setting can be adjusted in game from the Video tab of
# the Video panel of the Options menu using the "Field of View"
# slider.
field of view = 55.0

# Specify the format for screenshots taken by pressing F12.  This

# Set the isotropic texture filtering mode to bilinear or trilinear.
# Bilinear filtering is a texture filtering method used to smooth
# textures when displayed larger or smaller than they actually are.
# Bilinear filtering is reasonably accurate until the scaling of the
# texture gets below half or above double the original size of the
# texture.  Trilinear filtering is an extension of the bilinear
# texture filtering method, which also performs linear interpolation
# between mipmaps.  Both methods use mipmaps in OpenMW, and the
# corresponding OpenGL modes are LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST and
# LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR.  Trilinear filtering produces better texturing
# at a minimal cost on modern video cards.  This setting can be
# changed in game using the "Texture filtering" pull down in the
# Detail tab of the Video panel of the Options menu.
texture filtering = trilinear

[HUD]

camera sensitivity = 1.0

# This floating point setting controls the vertical camera/mouse

# setting, meaning that it should remain set at 1.0 unless the player
# desires to have different sensitivities in the two axes.
camera y multiplier = 1.0

# OpenMW will capture control of the cursor if this boolean setting is
# true.  In "look mode", OpenMW will capture the cursor regardless of
# the value of this setting (since the cursor/crosshair is always

# determines the behavior when the cursor is moved outside the OpenMW
# window.  If true, the cursor movement stops at the edge of the
# window preventing access to other applications.  If false, the
# cursor is allowed to move freely on the desktop.
#
# This setting does not apply to the screen where escape has been
# pressed, where the cursor is never captured.  Regardless of this
# setting "Alt-Tab" or some other operating system dependent key
# sequence can be used to allow the operating system to regain control
# of the mouse cursor.  This setting interacts with the "minimize on
# focus loss" setting by affecting what counts as a focus loss.
# Specifically on a two-screen configuration it may be more convenient
# to access the second screen with setting disabled.
grab cursor = true

# Invert the vertical axis while in "look mode".  If this setting is

# This boolean setting causes the behavior of the sneak key (Ctrl by

ui sensitivity = 1.0

[Map]

# It is not currently possible to control how many adjacent cells are
# displayed in the map.  It appears that this is hardcoded to one
# adjacent cell (3x3) in the code.  These settings control the canvas
# and resolution sizes, and therefore the amount of panning required
# to see the entire map, and the level of detail visible.

# This integer setting adjusts the scale of the world map in the GUI
# mode map display. The value is the width in pixels of each cell in
# the map, so larger values result in larger more detailed world maps,
# while smaller values result in smaller less detailed world maps.
# However, the native resolution of the map source material appears to
# be 9 pixels per unexplored cell and approximately 18 pixels per
# explored cell, so values larger than 36 don't produce much
# additional detail.  Similarly, the size of place markers is
# currently fixed at 12 pixels, so values smaller than this result in
# overlapping place markers.  Values from 12 to 36 are recommended.
# For reference, Vvardenfell is approximately 41x36 cells.
global map cell size = 18

# This integer setting controls the zoom level for the HUD map display
# (the map in the lower right corner while not in GUI mode).  A value
# of 64 results in the HUD map displaying one exterior cell.  Since
# the GUI mode map displays 3x3 cells, a value of approximately 21
# displays the same area as the GUI mode map.  Larger values increase
# the level of zoom, while smaller values are wasteful.
#
# Note that the actual size of the widget is always the same on the
# screen unless the "scaling factor" setting in the "GUI" section is
# changed.  Increasing both the scaling factor of the GUI and this
# setting does result in a higher resolution HUD map, but
# unfortunately with a scaled direction pointer on top of it.
local map hud widget size = 256

# This integer setting controls the resolution of the GUI mode local
# map widget.  Larger values generally increase the visible detail in
# map.  If this setting is half the "local map widget size" or
# smaller, the map will generally be be fairly blurry.  Setting the
# both options to the same value results in a map with good detail.
# Values that exceed the "local map widget size" setting by more than
# a factor of two are unlikely to provide much of an improvement in
# detail since they're subsequently scaled back to the approximately
# the map widget size before display.  The video resolution setting
# interacts with this setting in that regard.
local map resolution = 256

# This integer setting controls the canvas size of the GUI mode local
# map widget.  Larger values result in a larger physical map size on
# screen, and typically require more panning to see all available
# portions of the map.  This larger size also enables an overall
# greater level of detail if the "local map resolution" setting is
# also increased.
local map widget size = 512

[Video]

# This integer setting controls anti-aliasing.  Anti-aliasing is
# technique designed to reduce distortions called aliasing caused by

# Anti-aliasing can correct these distortions at the cost of a minor
# reduction in the frame rate.  A value of 0 disables anti-aliasing.
# Other powers of two (e.g. 2, 4, 8, 16) are supported according to
# the capabilities of your graphics hardware.  Higher values do a
# better job of correcting the distortion and have a greater impact on
# frame rate. This setting can be configured from a list of valid
# choices in the Graphics panel of the OpenMW Launcher.
antialiasing = 0

# This floating point setting controls the contrast correction for all

# disabled.
contrast = 1.00

# This floating point setting determines the maximum frame rate in
# frames per second.  If this setting is 0.0, the frame rate is
# unlimited.  There are several reasons to consider capping your frame
# rate, especially if you're already experiencing a relatively high
# frame rate (greater than 60 frames per second).  Lower frame rates
# will consume less power and generate less heat and noise.  Frame
# rates above 60 frames per second rarely produce perceptible
# improvements in visual quality.  Capping the frame rate may in some
# situations reduce the perception of choppiness (highly variable
# frame rates during game play) by lowering the peak frame rates.
# This setting interacts with the "vsync" setting in the Video section
# in the sense that enabling vertical sync limits the frame rate to
# the refresh rate of your monitor (often 60 frames per second).
framerate limit = 0.0

# This boolean setting determines whether the entire screen is used

# check box in the Graphic tab of the OpenMW Launcher.
fullscreen = false

# Theses two setting determine the horizontal and vertical resolution

# but may also introduce additional delays caused by having to wait
# until the appropriate time (the vertical blanking interval) to draw
# a frame.

# This setting can be adjusted in game using the "VSync" button in the

[Water]

# The water settings can be tested experimentally in the Water tab of
